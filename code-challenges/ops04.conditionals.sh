# Create a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options:
run_it=true                                            # identifies the variable true
while $run_it; do                                      # intitiates an infinite loop. script continue to run until user exits.
# Menu System
    echo "Menu System:"
    echo "1. Hello world!"
    echo "2. Ping self"
    echo "3. IP info"
    echo "4. Exit"

# User input should be requested
    read -p "What shall you choose? (1-4): " choice     # -p is paired with read to show the user the prompt. the choice is then stored in the variable 'choice'

# Conditional statement evaluating the user input, then act accordingly to the choice
    case $choice in                                     # case performs conditional branching based on the input from user/value of variable.

            ping -c 4 127.0.0.1                             # in the context of the ping command, -c specifies the number of ICMP echo requests (pings). in this case, that # is 4.
