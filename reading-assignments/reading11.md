# Reading 11: Windows Server

## Assignment Questions
**1. What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?**
- A server is used to run services that people can access across the network. It differs from a computer because it usually does not have its GUI activated and is usually used through the command line. 
- To describe a server and computer to a friend that has no knowledge of computers, I would make the comparison to a restaurant. As the computer, you are able to prioritize sitting in comfortable chairs, focusing on the meal and the fine dining experience. That meal is for individual use. Whereas, the restaurant's priority is providing goods and services for everyone in the restaurant. They don't prioritize certain things, because the main priority is delivering these services efficiently.

**2. How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?**
- The windows server does not receive updates at the same rate that Windows Home or Pro do. To create a more stable environment, the server is updated less frequently, and the user typically has control over when that happens. However, in Home and Pro, the updates typically happen automatically and more frequently unless otherwise specified.

**3. Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?**
- The Windows Server is allotted more hardware that the Windows Home or Pro. For example, the Windows server is may have up to 24 TB of RAM, while the computer may only have 2 TB. Also, the computers have a cap on cores, while the server's cores are unlimited.
