# Reading 12: Domain Controller

## Assignment Questions
**1. Explain the role of a Domain Controller?**
- Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of of PCs and control them from one place. A **domain controller** is the server that controls the domain and the PCs that are on it.

**2. What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?**
- The ability to log in with the same username and password to any computer on the domain allows for access to all resources on the network. It eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords, which inevitably lead to security issues when the user needs to write down all their passwords, etc. 
- The security risk is if the user's credentials are compromised, so is all the computers on the domain and its resources.

**3. Describe how group policies are used in domains?**
- Network administrators use group policies to to standardize each computer and ensure that only the appropriate users are able to make changes to the domain and its computers.

**4. In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?**
- A domain is useful for many things, and can be tweaked for each company. Being able to push mass updates or make changes to the security in case of breaches are ways that having a domain may be used.
