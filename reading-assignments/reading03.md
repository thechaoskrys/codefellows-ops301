# Reading 3: Network Segmentation

## Assignment Questions
**CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes**
1. What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
  - CIDR notation is a way of representing CIDR block, which is a range of IP addressed. 

2. How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
  - IPv4 is usually represented as a four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets separated by dots, e.g. 127.0.0.1.
  - **An octet is a group of 8 bits. A bit is the smallest unit of data in computers. Usually a 1 or 0.**

3. Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
  - The range of numbers found in an octet (using the decimal system) is 0-255.
  - An octet consists of 8 bits and may have 2 values (0 or 1), therefore, 2^8 totals 256, but starting at 0 makes it 255.

What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
  - This represents the how many bits make up the mask.

How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?

**What is Network Segmentation and Why it Matters?**
In your own words, describe network segmentation.
  - 

Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
  -

What is a screened subnet?
  -

Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
