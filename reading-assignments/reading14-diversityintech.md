## Assignment Questions

**Consider the history:** [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

**1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
- The number of women in computer science declined around the same time we started seeing personal computers in homes. Men were spending a lot of time at home tinkering, so they were at a much more advanced level than women who did not have the same opportunities. 
 
**2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
- In higher level education, it was expected of everyone to know certain information because computer science professors assumed that their students grew up playing on computers at home. Unfortunately, families were more likely to buy computer's for their boys over their girls, so it left the women who made the step in tech feel at a disadvantage. 

**Ask the question:** [Why diversity matters to your tech company?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

**1. When are diversity efforts most successful?**
- Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by commitment from company leaders. This requires leaders to know and understand why diversity matters. 

**2. Why do diverse companies perform better?**
- This is due to diverse groups having many different ways of seeing and solving a problem, therefore, there are faster and better ways of solving it. Diverse teams are found to be smarter and more creative. 

**3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
- A diverse company can serve a diver user base using the Youtube debacle as an example. The iOS app development team was almost entirely right-handed which lead to all left-handed users having their videos upside down. Had this team been more diverse, the app could have been developed keeping in mind left-handed users to begin with.
